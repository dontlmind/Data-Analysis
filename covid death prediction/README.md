<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The COVID-19 is an ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019. As of 19 November
2020, more than 56.1 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 1.34 million deaths attributed to
COVID-19.
The research question of interest relates to the impact of COVID-19 on different age groups. An imaginary
government official makes the hypothesis that:

* The first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic, in March, April and May, primarily affected the elderly.
Deaths amongst the elderly in the spring were well above the historical averages, whereas the under
50’s had deaths in line with previous years.
  
* The second wave began in September and was caused by irresponsible young people, primarily university undergraduates, acting irresponsibly. In the most recent death data, there is an increase in deaths
in the under 50’s whereas the over 70’s have no more deaths than would be expected pre-covid.

### Data Source
Data is from daily mortality counts in Quebec:

<!-- RESULT -->
## Result

The study modeled the trend of mortality in Quebec for each age group and predicted the trending
without COVID-19, moreover, the excess deaths due to the COVID-19 epidemic.
As a result, this model supports the hypothesis that the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic, in March,
April and May primarily affected the elderly. The number of elderly deaths due to Covid-19 is significantly higher
than youth.

However, this study does not agree that the second wave, which began in September, is caused by
irresponsible young people. In evidence, the excess death of youth does not significantly increase compared
to the first wave. Also, it does not provide evidence that the elderly have no more deaths than would be
expected pre-covid.
